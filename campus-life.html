                        Physical Education Department Physical education is an integral part of young people’s education. In this course, students can learn about the importance of being physically active as part of a healthy lifestyle. Physical Education Department has an important
                        contribution to make in supporting students to discover ways in which they can increase their enjoyment, confidence and competence in a range of physical activities. They can learn about health-related fitness and to take responsibility
                        for being physically active now and in the future. Overall, they can develop positive attitudes to physical activity and its importance in a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle. Physical Education Department at MITM provides an opportunity
                        for all students to involve themselves in physical activity. The purpose and focus of PED at MITM is to identify skills and hidden talents among the students and motivate to excel themselves in the field of Physical education.
                        Students can experience success in different ways in physical education. For some, the pursuit of excellence and the achievement of sporting goals will be the focus. For some, organising, leading and facilitating others to be physically
                        active will be the measure of success. For others, including regular physical activity as part of a healthy lifestyle will represent a successful outcome. By using different curriculum models, students are supported not only to
                        improve their performance in different physical activities but also to develop their understanding of the factors which impact on their personal performance and participation in physical activity.

                            <p>Welcome to the sports department of Maharaja Institute of Technology, we are very proud to be a part of an institute which as carved a niche in various sports activities<br/>At MIT we firmly believe that Sports not only provides
                                entertainment but also helps embedding students with life skills which would help them through their lives. Sports today cannot be seen just as a form of physical activity but an engagement which helps in adding value and
                                building character in students. Infect, sports offer wide ranging benefits and should be encouraged fully in view of the following.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Sports help to inculcate values such as dedication, discipline and responsibility in students .most sports require that the person playing it be athletic or at lest be fit. While one can keep fit by going to the Gym.Sports
                                    offers more fun in the process of keeping fit.</li>
                                <li> Most sports involve exercise, which facilitates soothing of the mind, as the feel good hormones of the body called endorphins are released. These are natural stress busters which induce a relaxed feeling.</li>
                                <li>Most sports have an outcome where one player wins and the other loses. Winning and losing is a part of life as its part of sports too. Sports inculcate this much needed lesson in students so that they have the ability to
                                    accept failures with grace and move on to achieve Grater things in the face of adversity.</li>
                            </ol>
